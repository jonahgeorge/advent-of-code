Initially begun implementing as a few loops and index variables but quickly became displeased with how messy things were getting.

Next, implemented the Iterator and IntoIterator traits which led to a very simple solution to Part 1.

Because Part 2 requires the ability to jump ahead, I decided to scrap the Iterator approach and instead implement Index.
